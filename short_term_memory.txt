1. Create a file named 'hello.txt' in the current directory.
2. Write 'hello world!' to the 'hello.txt' file.
3. Save the 'hello.txt' file.
Note: The tasks are already in the correct order, so no further prioritization is needed. The duplicates are also removed.
The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$
Note: The answer is not 3, but 3 is the correct answer because the tasks are already in the correct order and duplicates are removed.
